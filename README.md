### NBA Draft Prediction Project

This is a project that I conducted during my time at the University of Waterloo! Myself and my partner, Cameron McMullen, conducted this project from start to finish in about 8 weeks, on top of other classes and demands.

The goal was to model NBA draft decisions, using NBA Combine results, as well as player college performances.

The data was collected from these two sources, and combined in the .Rmd file found in this repository.

I always love to learn and grow, and everything is a work in progress. If you see something that I could or should be improving on,
please don't ever hesitate to reach out!

#### Data sources:
[College Basketball Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021)
  Contains detailed gametime statistics for over 25000 different college basketball players from different tournaments
  throughout their respective college careers. For this project, only the most recent college performance was used
  for our algorithms to reduce redundancy, and because it is the most highly correlated with draft outcomes.
[NBA Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball)
  A SQL-style database containing high-volume data on players, teams, and play-by-play information. We were interested
  in draft outcomes, so we pulled player names, ID numbers, draft outcomes, and several other metrics of interest.
