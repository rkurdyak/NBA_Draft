This is a project that I conducted during my time at the University of Waterloo!

The goal was to model NBA draft decisions, using NBA Combine results, as well as player college performances.

The data was collected from these two sources, and combined in the .Rmd file found in this repository.

I always love to learn and grow, and everything is a work in progress. If you see something that I could or should be improving on,
please don't ever hesitate to reach out!
